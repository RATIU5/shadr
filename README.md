# Shadr - The GLSL Creation App

![Shadr logo](/assets/img/shadr.webp)

This is the official repository of [Shadr.app](https://shadr.app/). Shadr allows users to create GLSL shaders easily in a node-based environment. Kind of like Blender's shader editor. Add and drag nodes and connect them together to create simple to complex shaders.

### How to develop
