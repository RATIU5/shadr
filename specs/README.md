# Specifications

This directory contains architecture and feature specs.

## Files

- `architecture.md` - System architecture (keep updated!)
- Feature specs go here as `feature-name.md`

## Creating Specs

1. Discuss requirements with AI
2. Ask it to write a spec
3. Review and iterate

Specs should include:

- What it does
- Requirements
- API/interface
- Edge cases
